Itunements
==========

Description: This app was created in order to help me practice the has_many :through association. Two groups, bands and fans, are linked through a join model named "Itunements" (or "Ituneships"). They are listed in the Ituneships index by their names rather than their IDs. Rails makes this all supremely easy.

Yes, I like Weezer.
